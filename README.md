# JobLander

**English | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)**

> A multi-agent engine for running a job search — with guardrails, human approval gates, and an eval harness.

I was laid off in 2026. Job hunting turned out to be a distributed-systems problem wearing a trench coat: the JD is in one tab, the recruiter thread in email, the interview notes in a doc, the salary research in a spreadsheet, the tracker in Notion, the resume in a folder named `final_v3_ACTUAL`. Nine tools, no source of truth, and every context switch taxed the one resource I actually needed — the ability to walk into the next interview knowing exactly where I stood.

So I built the system I wanted, while fighting with it. It ran my entire search. Then I got an offer, and now it's open source.

**Status:** battle-tested through a real job search, and now also running as a free, invite-only **hosted beta at [app.ailayoff.me](https://app.ailayoff.me)**. Web war room + all agents below are live, backed by 373 engine tests, 24 gateway tests and blind-review eval scripts.

*The command center: what to do right now, what's overdue, what's waiting for your approval. (All screenshots use a fictional demo dataset, and follow your light/dark setting.)*

> 🌐 **English and Chinese.** The web UI ships in both (switch in Settings), and AI-generated content — assessments, research, briefs, resumes, reports — follows the UI language. Prompts, `docs/DESIGN.md` and code comments are still Chinese; it was built as a personal tool first.

## Why this might be interesting

Even if you never run it, a few design decisions here were expensive to learn and might save you the tuition:

**The human is part of the topology, not a checkbox.** Every outward action — sending a message, writing to the calendar, updating the source of truth — goes through a proposal queue. Agents never touch the outside world directly. This isn't safety theater: it's what made the system usable under stress, because I could let it run without auditing every token.

**Loop patterns should be chosen by evidence, not vibes.** The due-diligence agent runs multi-turn ReAct, because every search round brings in genuinely new external information. Resume customisation started as ReAct too — and never converged. Three-round A/B experiments showed the evaluator just kept finding *new* opinions each round (5→4→5 fixable issues), because the information set inside the loop is closed. It got demoted to self-refine, then to single-shot. **A loop without external information entering it isn't reasoning, it's paraphrasing** — and you pay for it in latency and tokens. Details in `evals/`.

**Layout-as-code beats prompting for format compliance.** The resume customiser used to output complete HTML and was told "don't change the styles." It changed the styles. Now it outputs structured content JSON, and layout plus identity (name, contact) are rendered by fixed code. Style drift and identity fabrication became *impossible by construction* rather than *discouraged by instruction*.

**Judges must never be weaker than the thing they judge.** Evaluation runs on a dedicated model tier, with blind reviews whose information set is deliberately restricted (the recruiter reviewer sees only resume + JD, like a real screener), plus randomized mapping and zero-LLM hard checks — three defenses against a model rating its own family's output generously.

**Policy as code, not prose.** Walk-away numbers, equity discount tiers, and FX conversions are pure-function parameters in a private config. Negotiation judgments become explainable and regression-testable — and the actual numbers never enter the repo.

**Spend nothing where judgment isn't needed.** Scheduling constraint checks, format validation, red-line assembly, and resume rendering are all zero-LLM. The LLM is for judgment; everything else is code.

## Two ways to run it

**Hosted beta — nothing to install.** Sign in with Google at **[app.ailayoff.me](https://app.ailayoff.me)** (invite-only for now; ask the person who sent you here). Upload an old resume and it builds your arsenal, guesses the roles you're after and runs a first search. Each user gets their own isolated machine and encrypted disk in Singapore, free AI credit to start, and can export or permanently delete everything from Settings. Details: [privacy notice](https://app.ailayoff.me/_gw/privacy).

**Self-host — your machine, your keys.** The quickstart below. Everything stays local unless you configure integrations.

## Quickstart

Requires Python 3.10+ and an LLM API key (OpenAI or Gemini). Verified on 3.11 and 3.14, editable and regular installs.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shuailong/joblander.git
cd joblander
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
$EDITOR config.yaml            # set workspace_dir, llm, sentinel rules, policy numbers
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...   # or GEMINI_API_KEY

joblander onboard              # health-checks config, scaffolds the workspace
joblander web                  # war room at http://127.0.0.1:8899
```

`onboard` tells you exactly what's missing and scaffolds the workspace directory tree. Nothing else needs configuring to start — Notion, Gmail, and search integrations are optional and stay dormant until you fill them in.

**Your data never enters this repo.** The engine is code-only; resumes, compensation numbers, pipeline state, and red-line phrasing all live in a private `workspace_dir` that `config.yaml` (gitignored) points at. See DESIGN §13.

### Configuration map

| Section | Required | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `workspace_dir` | ✅ | Where all your private data lives |
| `llm` | ✅ | Provider + three model tiers (`model` / `model_flash` / `model_eval`); API key via env var |
| `sentinel.rules` | strongly recommended | Your red lines — the guard is inert without them |
| `policy` | needed for Analyst | `quote_tc_sgd` + `fx` are hard dependencies; discount tiers and reference conversions optional |
| `search` | needed for due diligence | Tavily (free tier is plenty), Brave, or Google CSE |
| `notion` | optional (legacy) | Background sync of the tracker to Notion; no longer surfaced in the web UI |
| `gmail` | optional | Auto-sourcing from email (read-only scope) |

### CLI

```bash
joblander web                     # the war room (this is the main interface)
joblander onboard                 # config health check + workspace scaffold
joblander research <company>      # zero-input due diligence
joblander brief <company>         # pre-interview brief
joblander check "<text>"          # run text past the Sentinel guard
joblander rescore <lead-id>       # pending proposal filename or stem; update score/gaps in place
joblander rescore --all-new       # rescore all New Leads using current Arsenal/preferences
joblander intake <file>           # add an opportunity from pasted text
joblander weekly                  # weekly report
joblander daemon                  # background jobs (calendar sync, reminders, scans)
```

Rescoring preserves lead metadata and saved job descriptions. Older leads use their saved attachment or excerpt and report limited context when applicable; descriptions are never fetched again. Failed assessments keep the previous score. Batch output shows live progress with each lead's old and new score, continues after failures, and ends with Rescored, Changed, Unchanged, and Failed counts. Rescored counts all attempts, including failures; Changed and Unchanged compare numeric scores for successful attempts. The command exits nonzero if any lead fails.

## What it looks like

*Every screenshot below uses a fictional demo dataset — the companies, people, and numbers are invented.*

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/images/sourcing-en-dark.webp">
  <img alt="New opportunities" src="docs/images/sourcing-en-light.webp">
</picture>

**New opportunities.** Overnight scans (job board + inbox) land here scored 1–5 against your achievement bank, grouped by company, with the specific requirement gaps spelled out — "Terraform production experience — your record shows use, not ownership." Nothing enters the pipeline until you approve it. Have specific companies in mind? List them as targets: joblander pulls their open roles straight from the careers page (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby; others via LinkedIn / MCF), shortlists the ones that fit, and keeps watching for new ones.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/images/war-room-board-en-dark.webp">
  <img alt="War room board" src="docs/images/war-room-board-en-light.webp">
</picture>

The **war room** — every opportunity on one board, dragged between stages, edited in place. Amber marks system-computed to-dos (unapproved proposals, due follow-ups); red marks the ones you flagged yourself as "ball's in my court."

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/images/company-page-en-dark.webp">
  <img alt="Company page" src="docs/images/company-page-en-light.webp">
</picture>

Each company gets a **dossier page**: stage flow, the one thing to do next, JD lifecycle, and a match radar whose axes are derived from *that specific JD* rather than a fixed template. The amber block is a proposal waiting for approval — you can edit the fields before it's written anywhere.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/images/timeline-en-dark.webp">
  <img alt="Timeline" src="docs/images/timeline-en-light.webp">
</picture>

The **timeline** is the company-level source of truth, and every entry is stamped `AI` or `人工` (human). You can always tell what the system claimed versus what you observed — which matters a lot when you're about to repeat something in an interview.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/images/playbook-en-dark.webp">
  <img alt="Staff HQ" src="docs/images/playbook-en-light.webp">
</picture>

**Staff HQ.** The capability radar plots what the market asks for against what your retros actually prove, rebuilt weekly from the JDs you're chasing — a dimension with no retro evidence scores low on purpose, and the gap becomes a concrete task. Below it, the pattern bank: every question you've faced, its best answer, and whether the last three attempts hit or missed. Two consecutive misses auto-escalate to `needs_work`.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/images/arsenal-en-dark.webp">
  <img alt="Arsenal" src="docs/images/arsenal-en-light.webp">
</picture>

The **arsenal** is the single source of every number that reaches a resume, an interview, or a brief. Append-only, edited section by section. The last section is a rules block — internal codenames to translate, figures that must not be rounded up — which feeds generation but never appears in this list.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/images/offers-en-dark.webp">
  <img alt="Offer comparison" src="docs/images/offers-en-light.webp">
</picture>

**Offer comparison** — quote at face value, compare at a discount. Here the offer with the *highest* headline package drops to last once unlisted options are discounted to zero, which is the entire point: the discount tiers are parameters in your private config, so the ranking is explainable and regression-testable.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/images/drill-en-dark.webp">
  <img alt="Drill ground" src="docs/images/drill-en-light.webp">
</picture>

The **drill ground** (opt-in under Settings → Features) — one random problem, tests run locally, no LLM involved. Keeping the coding muscle warm is part of the search, so it lives in the same place as everything else.

## Architecture

```
Perception          Agents                      Gate           Memory
──────────          ──────                      ────           ──────
Gmail scan   ┐                                                 Event Log (JSONL, SoT)
Notion diff  ├──►  Intelligence  ─┐                            Company archives
MCF/JP boards│     Resume        ─┼──► proposals ──► YOU ──►   Achievement bank
Paste/upload ┘     Operations    ─┘         ▲                  Playbook
                                            │                  Golden sets
                   Sentinel (cross-cutting) ┘
```

The **Event Log is the source of truth** (ADR-1); everything else is a projection that can be rebuilt from it. Notion, when enabled, is the most important *human* projection and edit surface — not the source of truth. Agents are stateless: context pack in, artifact or proposal out. Features are composed as workflows rather than one agent per feature (ADR-9).

Full architecture, 16 ADRs with rejected alternatives and accepted costs, state machines, and the Notion reconciliation design: **[`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md)** (Chinese).

### Cloud

The hosted beta lives in [`cloud/gateway`](cloud/gateway) — a small FastAPI gateway in front of unmodified engine instances:

- **Google sign-in + invite list**, HMAC-signed session cookie; Google only shares the email address.
- **One always-on Fly.io machine and encrypted volume per user**, reachable only over the private network. Each machine accepts requests only from the gateway, carrying a per-machine token — users can't reach each other's space.
- **Metering proxy** for the LLM and search APIs: user machines hold a metered sub-key, never the real API key; every call is priced from actual token usage against a per-user budget, and the engine stops cleanly when credit runs out.
- **Privacy built in:** consent before provisioning, one-click export (workspace zip + account records), permanent deletion (machine, volume and every gateway record), access logs without paths or content.

### Agent teams

#### 🕵️ Intelligence — see the other side before the fight

| Agent | Role | Architecture |
|---|---|---|
| **Diligence** | Zero-input company research: highlight card + four-section profile (every claim carries a numbered source) + per-round trail | **Multi-turn ReAct**: plans searches, then loops "read body excerpts → judge five-way coverage (hiring motive / interview process / tech stack / compensation / stability) → issue new queries for the gaps". Filters repeated queries, marks dead corners after consecutive misses, stops when no new pages appear. Quality gate: zero-LLM hard checks + five-dimension blind review |
| **Analyst** | JD + achievement bank + dossier + salary signals → two-score match snapshot + a radar whose axes are derived from that specific JD | LLM judgment + **policy-as-code**: walk-away lines and discount tiers are pure-function parameters |
| **Compensation** | A dated market-band report the moment a company enters the pool — numbers before conversations | Researcher evidence side + Analyst statistics side |

#### 📝 Resume — single-shot generation, two-tier review, one coach

| Agent | Role | Architecture |
|---|---|---|
| **Customiser** | Achievement bank + JD + accumulated feedback → tailored resume | **Single-shot, layout-as-code**. The automatic revision loop was removed after it failed to converge; improvement comes from persistently accumulated feedback, with every version regenerated whole |
| **Evaluator duo** | Separates "agent can fix it" from "needs material only you have" | ① **Recruiter blind review** — information set restricted to resume + JD; ② **Coach triage** — checks against the achievement bank, discipline: "search the bank before asking the user". Manually triggered, so it never taxes generation |
| **Coach** | Conversational intake: catches, classifies, archives whatever you throw in | Three-way classification (fact / opinion / reply); facts archived to specific bank entries, append-only, proposal-confirmed |

#### ⚙️ Operations — turn chores into drafts and proposals

| Agent | Role | Architecture |
|---|---|---|
| **Scout / Sourcing** | Email, pastes, job-board signals → standardized opportunity proposals | flash-tier extraction; discipline: null when unknown, never guess |
| **Scribe** | Interview transcripts / PDFs → fields + body + status proposals | Nothing written back until approved |
| **Prep** | Pre-interview brief built around situation assessment + what to do next, readable in 10 minutes | Prioritizes recent retros and the other side's feedback as evidence; **user gold standards frozen into an eval** (length budget, no list-dumping, Q&A quota, hallucinated-citation detection) with quotas hard-enforced in code; degrades to a template skeleton if the LLM is down |
| **Coordinator** | Pasted invitation → candidate slots → recommendation + reply draft (you send it) | Slot extraction uses an LLM; scheduling judgment is **pure rules** against your calendar |
| **Referral matcher** | Contact map → referrer suggestions + outreach draft (you send it) | Text retrieval + flash-tier selection |

#### 🛡️ Sentinel — cross-cutting guard, no bypass

Every outbound artifact is inspected. A **rule layer** catches phrasing red lines, numeric drift, and format violations; a **judgment layer** (LLM) handles what rules can't — narrative timing, cross-material consistency, semantic drift. The engine implements only rule *types* (`pattern` / `precision` / `pair`); the actual words and numbers live in your private config, so the public repo contains none of your red lines.

---

## Evals

Prompt systems without a regression set make every change a gamble (ADR-5), so evals were built alongside the system rather than after it:

```bash
python -m evals.resume_eval <company>     # recruiter blind review + coach triage
python -m evals.summary_eval <company>    # due-diligence summary: hard checks + 5-dim review
python -m evals.brief_eval <company>      # pre-interview brief against user gold standards
python -m evals.user_agent                # LLM plays the user and walks the running web UI
pytest                                    # 373 engine tests
(cd cloud/gateway && pytest)              # 24 gateway tests
```

Each eval pairs **zero-LLM hard checks** (deterministic, catch format and discipline violations for free) with **LLM blind review** (judgment). The golden sets themselves are private — they're built from real job-search data.

---

## What this is not

- **Not a job-application bot.** It never applies on your behalf, never sends a message, never posts anything. Every outward action is a draft that you send. That's a deliberate design constraint (ADR-10), not a missing feature.
- **Not a shared-database SaaS.** The self-hosted engine is single-user and local-first. The hosted beta doesn't change that model — it gives every user their own isolated engine instance behind a thin gateway (see [Cloud](#cloud)).
- **Not a framework.** Orchestration is hand-written on purpose (ADR-6) — at this scale the framework would have black-boxed the most instructive part.
- **Not tuned for you yet.** The policy numbers are Singapore/SGD-shaped, the prompts are Chinese, and the Sentinel rules are empty until you write your own. Set `JOBLANDER_TZ` to your own timezone — it defaults to UTC+8.

---

## Support

JobLander is free and stays free — Apache-2.0, nothing to upsell. The hosted beta is free for invited users, with a per-user AI credit cap to keep costs sane. If it helped you land something, the best thanks is passing it on to the next person who's searching.
